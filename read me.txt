 Using Netflix and IMDB dataset, making interactive tool to show different results and insights from the data (map – histogram-bar chart-pie chart-boxplot…etc.)  using plotly library and seaborn

i tried to make it interactive using dash code as given , but i had problems with dash installation and i could'nt call the functions that's why i didn't continue changing the whole code from static to interactive dash plots
